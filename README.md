# Data_Snacks
During the pandemic my snack of choice became the fruit gummy snacks from mott's. After a while I started to notice some abnormalities. I always buy to 10 pack option but noticed every once in a while there was an 11th pack in the box. Inside the packs there are usually 8 gummies but occasionally there would be a nineth. I also felt that my favorite gummy, the berry one, was consistently less prevelent on average. So I thought, I could start collecting data and and quantify these observations. 

This project will be writen almost exclusively in python/jupyter notebook. Currently I only expect to use pandas, matplotlib/seaborn, possibly numpy and maybe some statistical packages. 

There is no real usage for this unless you also enjoy a large amount of motts gummies and want to compare results!

# Data_Snacks
During the pandemic my snack of choice became the fruit gummy snacks from mott's. After a while I started to notice some abnormalities. For this reason I decided to start collecting data to answer some questions.

1. For boxes that are supposed to have 10 packs in them, how often is there a different amount
2. How many gummies are in each pack. 
3. There are 5 different gummy types. How equally are they distributed
4. If 2 packs are choosen, how often is it that I will get at least 2 of every gummy type.

I always buy the 10 pack option but noticed every once in a while there was an 11th pack in the box. I want to be able to see how often this is the case. Inside the packs there are usually 8 gummies but occasionally there would be a 9th. I want to explore if this is common or the exception. Next, My favorite gummy is the berry gummy but I always felt it was less prevelent than my least favorite, the carrot. I want to use data science to confirm my suspicions. Finally, as a weird tick of mine, I like to eat 2 packs at a time. I also want to have a handful of 1 of each gummy type and eat them symetrically. However, since there is a non standard distribution, this isn't always possible. I want to see If I can tell how Often I was able to do this.  

This project will be writen almost exclusively in python/jupyter notebook. Currently I only expect to use pandas, matplotlib/seaborn, and numpy.

There is no real usage for this unless you also enjoy a large amount of motts gummies and want to compare results!
